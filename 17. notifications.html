        Greetings everyone, This week in Thread, we focus our attention on the Law &amp; the Prophets. The Torah (law)
        contains some 613 commandments (mitzvot), which cover everything from dietary restrictions to treating skin
        diseases to sexual ethics to the role and function of the priesthood. As contemporary followers of Jesus, how
        are we to understand the role of Torah in our lives? One of the primary questions we will consider this week is
        what the Torah teaches us about God and his disposition towards his people. How does the Torah reflect God&#39;s
        heart of loving-kindness that he desires to show us and instill in us? I hope and pray that the Spirit blesses
        you as you meditate on the Torah and that through it you experience the loving-kindness of our heavenly Father.
        May his teachings and instructions continue to create in us a heart of loving-kindness as well.
        <br /><br />Grace &amp; Peace <br />Jake

        Greetings Friends, This week, our church family meditates on the theme of Presence. In the Thread podcast, Dave
        and Hannah are joined by renowned scholar Bernard McGinn for a conversation on Christian mysticism. Initially,
        the concept of mysticism may be intimidating or even off-putting for many of us. Dave, Hannah, and Bernard do an
        outstanding job of de-mystifying mysticism. Drawing on the biblical tradition and the examples and writings of
        men and women through Christian history, we are reminded that God&#39;s desire is not just that we know him
        intellectually but that we experience him relationally. May our hearts, minds, and souls be opened to experience
        God&#39;s presence and enjoy a continual relationship with him. <br /><br />Grace &amp; Peace <br />Jake

      <p class="greetings-friends-t-1 manrope-medium-pickled-bluewood-16px">
        Greetings friends, This week, our journey through God&#39;s story takes us into the wilderness. This story of
        YHWH leading his people, Israel, out of slavery and into the wilderness, serves as a beautiful image for our own
        spiritual journeys. While a large part of us would love to live in victory on the far side of the sea, it is
        only through journeying in and through the wilderness that we can be shaped to maturity and know the joy
        available in the promised land. In the podcast, Dave &amp; Hannah walk us through fundamental aspects of
        wilderness: 1. Our lives are interwoven with God. 2. Wilderness is meant to disorient &amp; awaken. 3.
        Wilderness&#39;s purpose is to form &amp; re-form. 4. We will always be in some state of wilderness. 5. God acts
        in love and for love in wilderness. May our time meditating on the biblical theme of wilderness help us locate
        ourselves on our own journey, encourage us, and deepen our trust in the God who lovingly leads us. <br />Grace
        &amp; Peace, Jake
